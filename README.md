# Movie-Recommendation-System
Major Project in Machine Learning under Professor Richa Singh


Using Movielens dataset developed a personalized movie recommendation system 

Dataset consists of movies.csv and ratings.csv

Very huge dataset of approximately 2 crore 30 lakhs ratings

Collaborated on preprocessing and analysis of movies for accurate and relevant recommendations

Implemented machine learning algorithms like K-Means, KNN and Cosaine Similarity

Finally recommended top 20 movies based on the movie given by the user


### Problem Statement
The purpose of a recommendation system basically is to search for content that would be
interesting to an individual. Recommendation systems are Artificial Intelligence based
algorithms that skim through all possible options and create a customized list of items that are
interesting and relevant to an individual. These results are based on their profile, search/browsing
history, what other people with similar traits/demographics are watching, and how likely you are
to watch those movies.
Your aim will be to recommend similar movies if a type of movie is given.

### Solution
Both supervised and unsupervised algorithms are used. K-means and KNN are used to recommend movies to the user based on his ratings. consine similarity is used to give recommendation based on a particular movie.
